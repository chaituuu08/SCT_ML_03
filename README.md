# SCT_ML_03 – Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM

## 📌 Task Objective
To classify images of cats and dogs using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm. The task uses a subset of the Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset for binary image classification.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Downloaded and preprocessed image data (resizing, grayscale conversion)
- Extracted features using basic image flattening / Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- Trained an SVM classifier to distinguish between cat and dog images
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV / PIL for image processing
- Scikit-learn (SVM, train_test_split, metrics)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## 📊 Output
- Achieved classification accuracy of ~XX% on test set
- Successfully visualized confusion matrix
- Sample predictions included for verification

## 📚 What I Learned
- How SVM works for image classification
- Preprocessing techniques for image data
- Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
- Evaluation of ML models for image tasks
